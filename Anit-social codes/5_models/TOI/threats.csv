"scope_logger.cc doesn't exist in libshill-net users, like apmanager.
  
  Do we move it under common/ and make apmanager depend on a separate shared library, just for that tiny shill-specific piece of code?

  Do we tell library callers to implement the ScopeLogger class just so that libshill-net links?
