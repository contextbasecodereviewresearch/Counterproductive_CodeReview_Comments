"@zhiyan, thanks for helping explanation. Overall it's correct. And you're suggestion makes sense for me, will improve it in next PS.
  
  @iccha, actually, this patch is related to https://review.openstack.org/#/c/63707/ in that patch, we're trying to set image size if the image is transferring from 'queued' to 'active' directly when user add/update locations for the image. The try/except can make sure we can iterate all the locations to get an available image. I improve it at here since it's breaking some unit test cases since we're introducing some new behaviour by this change. Does it make sense for you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
