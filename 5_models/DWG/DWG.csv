description,Discouragement without guide
This code is a real mess. I can't even begin to understand what you were trying to achieve here,1
You've used too many unnecessary variables. It's making the code confusing and inefficient,1
I don't understand why you've written the code this way. It doesn't follow any coding standards,1
"There's a lot of duplication in your code. It's not efficient or maintainable.""",1
Your code lacks proper documentation. How am I supposed to know what it's doing?,1
This code seems to be completely off-topic. It doesn't fit in with the rest of the project at all,1
You've ignored our coding conventions completely. It doesn't even look like Java code,1
I'm not sure if you've tested this code at all. It's full of bugs,1
You've not used any comments in your code. It's impossible to understand your logic,1
Your method names are not descriptive. It's hard to understand their purpose,1
"You've hard-coded values here, that's a bad practice. Always consider using constants",1
Your code is not thread-safe. It can lead to unexpected behavior,1
There are no unit tests in your code. It's always necessary to validate your logic,1
You've ignored error handling in your code. Always think about potential exceptions and errors,1
You're not following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It's a basic programming concept,1
Your code lacks proper formatting and indentation. It's difficult to read and understand,1
You've not used proper data structures. It leads to inefficient solutions,1
Your use of nested if-else statements is confusing. Consider using switch-case or map-based approach,1
You're using outdated methods. There are modern Java features that can perform these tasks more efficiently,1
You've not modularized the code. It's all crammed together in one large block. It's hard to understand and maintain,1
"But you still have the data() used as null-terminated string below. StringPiece::data() generally does not guarantee the terminator.
 
 Keep this as is, we will deal with it later.",1
Die. Die. Die XML. I'd remove this hideous reminder of a long-lost sad world.,1
"I really don't like this, we should remove all of them instead of adding more.",1
"arse, I had a change which did this but backed it out because it was more disruptive ;)",1
Basically: if self.microversion and 'X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version' in headers and headers['X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version'] != self.microversion: self.fail('bad test setup i hate you so much') And: if not self.microversion and 'X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version' in headers: self.fail('oh you dirty bastard'),1
Damn!,1
Done. Curse my cargoculting!,1
"I don't agree here, property in python are awful, especially when you want to test such methods.",1
"I really hate those. Not sure what the officiel OpenStack policy is, though.",1
"I think this solution is braindead also, like the previous one. Can we try to ass the null.? Anyway, +2 because safe.",1
"It doesn't relate to your patch, but please, remove this dots. It sucks and unreadable! Also, If this module will be moved in the future, everything will break. I prefer to use this simple code: import rally lookup_dirs = [templates_dir, os.path dirname(rally)]",1
"OK, just seems ugly to me is all. If you use mock, you don't have to worry about mox or stubs. I'll already grant that some think that using mock is ugly too...",1
"Sorry, but this is so horribly ugly (and error-prone)",1
this is actually terrible ...,1
WTF,1
wtf...,1
You are an evil :O!,1
"I have a doubt (which could be dumb). 'fqdn' should be resolved with in the namespace context or the host context ?
  In this fix, I am assuming it to be host context.",1
"I think you're just missing my point, or I am stupid enough to be unable to convey it properly.",1
"Is there any reason you don't fail if this is not true? Seems like a mangled header would get by this check.
  
  nit: startswith may read cleaner",1
"nit: A little ugly / confusing why you don't need this in write_len. Maybe just store addr in a temp variable and put it in both ""if"" statements?",1
Please clean up after this fails before returning.,1
this is useless if you use a boolean.,1
This one looks to be useless.,1
this should be setup_receiver (PEP8),1
useless line,1
Useless trailing '-'. See the implementation of rand_name(),1
worse!!!!!!! how does setuptools/cliff even do that with the '_' -> ' ' mapping in place?,1
"ah, that's nice, encoding stuff already crap",1
"as previously, you need to put this in a USE_ANDROID_EMU block, and provide a solution that works with a single server for the non AndroidEmu build of QEMU2. I know that sucks, sorry about that :(",1
Damn! Thought I'd gotten rid of it everywhere. New patch incoming,1
"Does this mean that if the header is corrupt, we're screwed?",1
How the heck did that get in there? Done....,1
"Just a style note: this is really *ugly* indentation. Also, is there a reason you couldn't use the decorator mocks and avoid the nesting?",1
"OMG, this alias is terrible!",1
"ooh, burn!",1
"Output formatting is kind of ugly right now, yeah.",1
"that English language stuff always confused the hell out of me.... yep, I kept wordsmithing this line and still didn't like it.",1
"The caching is only necessary for the performance benefit of not needing to do that service query from the DB every time we get an instance, which doubles the traffic to the DB on every instance query, which kind of sucks.
  
  Agree with leaving the caching in, that was my point with removing the TODO so we don't forget about this.",1
"The caching is only necessary for the performance benefit of not needing to do that service query from the DB every time we get an instance, which doubles the traffic to the DB on every instance query, which kind of sucks.
  
  Agree with leaving the caching in, that was my point with removing the TODO so we don't forget about this.",1
"The CBManagerState change in the new SDK is so sucky :-( We did https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/587510/5/device/bluetooth/bluetooth_adapter_mac.mm#43 on Mac (and see discussion on bug linked from that CL). But if this is the only place, this is fine too.",1
"These function names - specifically the ""stub1, stub2"" are ugly.",1
"This is kind of ugly...
 I think instead you should pass the timeout with the function when you register it, and keep a private max timeout requested variable",1
"Uh yeah so at the risk of driving you insane, you've got weighters twice here where you caller them weighers everywhere else.
  
  /duck",1
"Yes, and ... crap.",1
Your ordering is a little ugly. BUG= and TEST= should be above all the tags an the Change-Id should be together with all the Signed-off-bys. Then maybe I would have noticed that git hash the first time I looked at this.,1
consider rename to current_l3_agents,0
